Running 'python gen_calendar.py' writes the calendar to 'calendar.svg' in
the current directory.

Parameters at the bottom of gen_calendar.py control the start and end date,
the mapping from dates to positions on the spiral, and everything else.

eog doesn't seem to be able to handle the label text set on curved paths. I
use Inkscape to render calendar.svg to a PDF file for printing.
